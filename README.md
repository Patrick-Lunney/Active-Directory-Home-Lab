# Active Directory Home Lab

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive, hands-on approach to building a foundational enterprise environment using Microsoft Active Directory. The lab was constructed in VMware Workstation and includes a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller and a Windows 10 client, configured within an isolated, private network.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase the core skills required for IT support and systems administration roles, including server deployment, domain configuration, user and group management, and client integration.
